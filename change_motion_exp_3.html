    <h1>BROWN UNIVERISITY</h1>
    <h3>CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPATION</h2>
    <p>
      You and your child are invited to take part in a Brown University
      research study. Your participation is voluntary.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        RESEARCHER: Roman Feiman, PhD, roman_feiman@brown.edu, 190 Thayer St, Providence, RI 02912
      </li>
      <li>
        PURPOSE: The study is about how people understand language. We are interested in what adult behavior is like so we can find out how language comprehension and production change as a person develops.
      </li>
      <li>
        PROCEDURES: You will be presented with images or text on a screen and asked to respond to them as quickly as possible. You will be asked to respond using the mouse or keyboard.
      </li>
      <li>
        TIME INVOLVED: The study will take approximately 30-45 minutes of your
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        COMPENSATION: The amount of compensation you will receive depends on the criterion and the length of the study, in keeping with the averages and standards used in the Amazon Mechanical Turk community. 
      </li>
      <li>
        RISKS: There is no known or anticipated risk associated with your participation in this study. You may discontinue this study at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        BENEFITS: You may not directly benefit from being in this research study.
      </li>
      <li>
        CONFIDENTIALITY: Information gathered in these studies will remain strictly confidential and published reports will not mention individuals by name.  If shared, data will be identified solely by anonymized numerical codes.

        Because participants are recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk website or on Testable, participation happens over the internet and we have no information about participants’ identities. We collect Worker ID numbers through Amazon Mechanical Turk. These will be stored electronically on password-protected computers, to which only authorized researchers will have access. Following standard practice, we will record IP address to check whether a particular internet connection is being used an unreasonable number of times for the same experiment. This information will only be used to exclude multiple datasets generated from the same IP address.
        
        Brown University staff sometimes review studies like this one to make sure they are being done safely and correctly. If a review of this study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will protect your confidentiality.
        
      </li>
      <li>
        VOLUNTARY: You do not have to be in this study if you do not want to be. Even if you decide to be in this study, you can change your mind and stop at any time.

        <h2>Welcome! Thank you for participating in our study.</h2>
        <p><u>Important,</u> before you begin: </p>
        <p>Please do this experiment on a <b>laptop</b> or <b>desktop computer</b>.
            If you are viewing this experiment on a phone or a tablet, please close the window and
            return later with non-mobile device.</p>
        <p> Second: <b>please maximize the window for this browser and tab before
            you continue.</b></p>
        <p> Click 'continue' once you have maximized the window and you are ready
            to  move on.
        </p>
        <button id="continueInstructionButton1">continue</button>
</span>

<div id="Instruction2">
        <p>In this experiment, every trial will be more or less the same: 2 colored disks
            will be presented to the left and right of a central screen. Novel shapes will
            appear in the two disks. The shapes then will be removed, and the empty
            colored disks will move behind the screen. The screen will then be removed
            to display the two colored disks containing two shapes.
        </p>
        <p>If both shapes are the same as in the preview, press 1 to indicate they are the same.
            If one is replaced by a new shape, press 0 to indicate there is a new shape.
            The positions of the shapes and the colors of the disks in which they appear
            are entirely <b>irrelevant</b> to the task, so you should base your decision
            solely on the shapes inside of the circles.
        </p>
        <p>Click 'Practice' so you can try it!</p>

<div id="Instruction3">
    <p>The pratice is now complete. The experiment is about to start. The experiemnt will take
        around 40 mintues.
    </p>
    <p>Click 'Start' when you are ready. Remember, your job is to press 1 or 0 on
        the keyboard as fast as possible to indicate whether the two shapes are the same as
        you saw before the disks move, or there is a new shape.
