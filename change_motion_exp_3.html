        <h2>Welcome! Thank you for participating in our study.</h2>
        <p><u>Important,</u> before you begin: </p>
        <p>Please do this experiment on a <b>laptop</b> or <b>desktop computer</b>.
            If you are viewing this experiment on a phone or a tablet, please close the window and
            return later with non-mobile device.</p>
        <p> Second: <b>please maximize the window for this browser and tab before
            you continue.</b></p>
        <p> Click 'continue' once you have maximized the window and you are ready
            to  move on.
        </p>
        <button id="continueInstructionButton1">continue</button>
</span>

<div id="Instruction2">
        <p>In this experiment, every trial will be more or less the same: 2 colored disks
            will be presented to the left and right of a central screen. Novel shapes will
            appear in the two disks. The shapes then will be removed, and the empty
            colored disks will move behind the screen. The screen will then be removed
            to display the two colored disks containing two shapes.
        </p>
        <p>If both shapes are the same as in the preview, press 1 to indicate they are the same.
            If one is replaced by a new shape, press 0 to indicate there is a new shape.
            The positions of the shapes and the colors of the disks in which they appear
            are entirely <b>irrelevant</b> to the task, so you should base your decision
            solely on the shapes inside of the circles.
        </p>
        <p>Click 'Practice' so you can try it!</p>

<div id="Instruction3">
    <p>The pratice is now complete. The experiment is about to start. The experiemnt will take
        around 40 mintues.
    </p>
    <p>Click 'Start' when you are ready. Remember, your job is to press 1 or 0 on
        the keyboard as fast as possible to indicate whether the two shapes are the same as
        you saw before the disks move, or there is a new shape.
